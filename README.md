# Solana-Betting-Game

This game is a digital "Minesweeper-inspired" gambling game that leverages the popularity of chance- based gaming with cryptocurrency integration, creating a unique combination of risk, reward, and strategic decision-making. The game invites players to test their luck and nerves as they reveal tiles on a 5x5 grid, aiming to avoid hidden "mines" and increase their winnings.
Players wager cryptocurrency (in this case, Solana, or "SOL") and attempt to uncover safe tiles to increase their payout multiplier. With each safe tile revealed, the potential winnings grow, but hgit itting a mine results in an instant loss of the wager. The player can cash out at any time, adding a strategic layer of risk management as they decide whether to press on or secure their current earnings.


# Getting users
A decentralized rewards platform with a multilevel structure.
The idea is that users can join by contributing funds, and their rewards are based on future contributions from others in the system. 
Unlike traditional multilevel systems, thereâ€™s no need for users to invite or refer others to participate; instead, everyone automatically benefits from new contributions made by those who join after them. 
The rewards scale proportionally based on each participant's contribution to the total pool, making it fair and transparent.
